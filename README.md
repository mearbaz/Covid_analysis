Overview The COVID-19 project aims to analyze and visualize data related to the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The project involves data preprocessing, merging, and analysis to identify trends, patterns, and correlations.

Data Sources :

The project uses data from various sources, including:
The New York Timesâ€™ GitHub repository: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data
The John Hopkins University COVID-19 dataset
Other publicly available datasets

Objectives :

To demonstrate the effectiveness of social distancing as a weapon against COVID-19 using a simple programmatic approach
To preprocess and merge datasets to calculate needed measures and prepare them for analysis
To identify trends, patterns, and correlations in COVID-19 data
To predict the number of patients who will get infected in the near future using machine learning models
To develop predictive and analytic models for forecasting the vulnerability and recovery rate of patients affected by COVID-19

Methods :

Data preprocessing and cleaning
Data merging and aggregation
Statistical analysis and visualization using Seaborn
Machine learning modeling using linear regression (LR)

Results :

The analysis suggests that, if no new waves of infection emerge, the COVID-19 epidemic will be controlled in the US (<5000 new daily cases) by September 26th, and the maximum of confirmed cases will reach 4,160,000.
The proposed model can be used to detect the emergence of possible new waves of infections in the future.
Conclusion This project demonstrates the importance of data analysis and visualization in understanding the COVID-19 pandemic. The results highlight the effectiveness of social distancing and the potential of machine learning models in predicting the spread of the virus.
